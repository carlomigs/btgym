        "\n",
        "- Using expert actions is proven way to speed up training by exploring more relevant state-action space regiones;\n",
        "\n",
        "- It can also lead to suboptimal policies when demonstrated actions are suboptimal (learnt model is irrelevant) and agent is strictly entingled   to expert trajectories (cannot explore and act on it's own);\n",
        "- So it is essential to find ballanced degree of agent dependensy on advisor;\n",

        "\n",
        "- For each train episode expert has access to entire data range but does not provides complete state-action trajectories. Instead it fits simple local model of `external` part of the environment which provides  `advises` in form of categorical probability distribution in action space. Morover, imitation loss is defined in actions subspace, namely over 'buy' and 'sell' actions. Such relaxed conditions seems to work better than strictly following [possibly suboptimal] expert trajectory.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Note that expert advices conditioned on external state observations only, i.e. price dynamics; expert doesn't account current inner agent state (opened position, acoount value etc.). It can be said it acts similar to real-life financial advisor'...now it probably time to buy'; it does not bear any responsibility for advices given so it is on agent's side to deside follow or not. The degree of agent 'independency' from oracle is regulated by `guided_lambda` hyperparamter. When set to zero - oracle advises completely ignored. When set >> 1 it can be clearly seen (with sine wave data for example) than agent performace is degraded due to strong dependency from oracle; reasonable values for this setup seems to lie  within 0.1 .. 1.0 range;"
